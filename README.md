# Multithreading with Async/Await
The repository was created as a Playground to test out different features of C# within the domain of multithreading.

My research was documented into a series of blogs on dev.to

[In the first one](https://lnkd.in/gy-pR33):
I made a simple example of making a cup of tea, synchronously. I pointed out what could go wrong with the approach and I tried to fix it asynchronously.

[In the second one](https://lnkd.in/g6tkHNR):
I got to modify the code base a little bit, to make the execution of independent methods run in parallel.

[And in the last part of the series](https://lnkd.in/gkUrYDi):
I noted down 4 tips and tricks, DOs and DON'Ts that could be applied in different situations.

You are a perfect candidate for this series if you are still learning or just starting to develop with C# and .NET

Here is the [link](https://lnkd.in/ggCgCeG) for the full series.
